merge t4205-locales

  Rejected as it will be fixed in a different way in the original
  author's incremental updates to this series.  This should be
  detectable as a conflict during rebuild so I'm keeping it around to
  avoid test failures.

merge rebase-i-comment-squash

  Comment out the first line of a "!squash" commit when generating a
  commit message in git-rebase.

  Merged to jk/pu on 2013-03-30.  Dogfooding for a while to see if
  this is a sensible change.
