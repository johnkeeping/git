merge origin/jk/trailing-slash-in-pathspec

  Submitted upstream as v2.

merge rebase-i-comment-squash

  Comment out the first line of a "!squash" commit when generating a
  commit message in git-rebase.

  Merged to jk/pu on 2013-03-30.  Dogfooding for a while to see if
  this is a sensible change.

merge rebase-upstream-reflog

  Submitted upstream.

  Use the reflog when no rebase root is specified so that we can do
  better at avoiding conflicts when the upstream branch has been
  rewritten.
