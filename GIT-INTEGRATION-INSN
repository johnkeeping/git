  Comment out the first line of a "!squash" commit when generating a
  commit message in git-rebase.

. merge rebase-upstream-reflog

  Use the reflog when no rebase root is specified so that we can do
  better at avoiding conflicts when the upstream branch has been
  rewritten.

  Breaks t3400 @{upstream} test.
