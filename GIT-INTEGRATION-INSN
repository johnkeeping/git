merge rebase-i-comment-squash

  Comment out the first line of a "!squash" commit when generating a
  commit message in git-rebase.

  Merged to jk/pu on 2013-03-30.  Dogfooding for a while to see if
  this is a sensible change.

merge rebase-upstream-reflog

  Submitted upstream.

  Use the reflog when no rebase root is specified so that we can do
  better at avoiding conflicts when the upstream branch has been
  rewritten.

  Waiting for jc/merge-base-reflog to stabilise and graduate before
  re-rolling this to use the new functionality introduced there.

merge pull-use-is-ancestor

  Now uses --fork-point to replace the shell loop.

merge log-cherry-no-merges

  Don't consider merges for cherry comparison.

merge split-instaweb

  Split the instaweb script to have each HTTP daemon in its own file.
